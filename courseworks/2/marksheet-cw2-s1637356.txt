 - Clear statement of hypothesis / motivation [3/3]
 - Experimental methodology and implementation [8/8]
 - Experimental results [4/5]
 - Discussion and conlusion [2/4]
 
Composition of L1+L2 is not properly defined. Results are not interpreted and discussion doesn’t cover any of the technical aspects for why results are like that.

Experiment 2 (25 marks). 
Marks awarded for experimental hypothesis / motivation, completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results, discussion and conclusions.  Weighted by difficulty of task.
 - Clear statement of hypothesis / motivation [3/3]
 - Implementation [8/8]
 - Experimental methodology [3/5]
 - Experimental results [3/5]
 - Discussion and conlusion [3/4]

Exploration is very limited to just a few scenarios, not enough to get a better understanding of the impact of data augmentation.
 
Experiment 3 (25 marks).

Interesting exploration for CNNs. There is space for improvement for results interpretation.

Tables should have caption and a number. Figures should also have a captions describing what they present. Your tables should be adjusted in such a way they don’t overflow cells over many lines if there is still space left on the page to the right.
Network structure is not presented. Hyper parameters are not presented.
There are many mistakes in the text.

Additional Excellence (10 marks). 
Marks awarded for significant personal insight, creativity, originality, and/or extra depth and academic maturity.  [0/10]
