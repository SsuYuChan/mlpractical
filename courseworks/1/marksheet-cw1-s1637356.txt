Marking scheme

Student ID:  s1637356

Total Mark: 84/100

A very good report.

Part 1, Learning Rate Schedules (10 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -implement one time-dependent schedule [5/5]
 -comparison of time-dependent vs constant learning rate [2/2]
 -explore hyperparameters [3/3]
 
Very good.

Part 2, Momentum Learning Rule (15 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -implement momentum with hyperparameter [5/5]
 -compare vanilla GD vs GD+momentum for different momentum hyperparam values [3/3]
 -explore how momentum hyperparam influences training in terms of learning curve and final accuracy (training + validation sets) [4/4]
 -investigate momentum rate schedules [2/3]

Very good. On page 9 it says gamma <= tau, but in the experiments it seems like the opposite is true.

Part 3, Adaptive Learning Rules (40 marks). 
Marks awarded for completeness of implementation, experimental methodology, experimental results.
Check list
 -Implement two adaptive learning rules [20/20: 12 for the first, 8 for the second]
 -compare each adaptive learning rate vs GD+momentum vs vanilla-GD [10/10]
 -explore hyperparameter varition for each adaptive LR approach [5/10]

It would be good to do more experiments varying learning rates for the adaptive LRs.

Presentation and clarity of report (25 marks).
Marks awarded for overall structure, clear and concise presentation, providing enough information to enable work to be reproduced, clear and concise presentation of results, informative discussion and conclusions.
Check list
 - overall structure, organisation, and writing style [7/7]
 - clear description of experiments, reproducibility [7/7]
 - presentation of results [7/7]
 - discussion and conclusion [4/4]

The structure is clear and the experiments are well defined. The figures easily allow comparisons and flow well with the text. Discussions are good.

Additional Excellence (10 marks). 
Marks awarded for significant personal insight, creativity, originality, and/or extra depth and academic maturity.
